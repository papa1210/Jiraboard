Roadmap for migrating from localStorage to a multi-user, dockerized deployment

1) Data + API redesign
- Pick DB (Postgres preferred), define schema (users, projects, tasks, comments, attachments, audit).
- Design API (REST/GraphQL) with auth (JWT/session) and basic authorization per user/project.

2) Build backend
- Create API service (Node/Express/Fastify/Nest) with migrations/seeds (Prisma/Knex).
- Implement CRUD for tasks/resources + auth (register/login/logout).
- Add tests (unit for services, integration for API with test DB).

3) Frontend integration
- Replace localStorage with API calls; state scoped per user.
- Add auth flows (login/register/logout) and route guards; handle loading/error states.
- Use env for API base URL (e.g., VITE_API_URL for dev/prod).

4) Dockerization (dev + prod)
- Dockerfile frontend (build Vite, serve via Nginx) and Dockerfile API (Node runtime).
- Docker Compose for dev: frontend + api + db, with code volumes and db volume.
- Compose/stack for prod: build/pull images, persistent volumes, reverse proxy if needed.

5) CI/CD
- GitHub Actions: lint/test/build; build/push images (API + frontend) to registry (GHCR/Docker Hub).
- Tag images by commit/branch; optional deploy job or webhook to server.

6) Server setup
- Prepare target machine (LAN/VPS): install Docker/Compose, open ports 80/443 (and 5432 if needed internally).
- Clone repo or only pull images; run compose with env/secret files; set volumes for DB and backups.
- If public: domain + TLS (Let’s Encrypt via nginx/traefik).

7) Operations
- Manage secrets via env files/secret store; never commit .env.
- Backups: scheduled pg_dump for DB; restore procedure documented.
- Monitoring basics: docker logs, healthchecks, restart policies; consider resource limits (cpu/mem).
